The Weather App with Interactive Map is a responsive web application that allows users to search for real-time weather information for any city and view its location on an interactive map. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data and Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap for map visualization.

Users simply enter a city name, and the app fetches current weather details such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. At the same time, the map automatically updates to show the city’s exact location with a marker, providing a clear geographical context.

This project is fully client-side and is ideal for learning how to integrate third-party APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript operations, and combine weather data with map-based visualization in a clean and modern UI.
